<p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. <br>Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. <br>Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. <br>Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.<br> The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p>
